// The useCallback hook is closely related to useMemo, but it focuses on memoizing functions rather than values. It's particularly useful when passing callback functions to child components. Here's a breakdown:

// Purpose: useCallback is used to memoize (cache) a function so that it's only recreated when its dependencies change. This can optimize performance when passing callbacks as props.

// Usage: You provide a function and an array of dependencies to useCallback. React returns a memoized version of the function. If the dependencies change, a new memoized function is created.

// Typical Use Cases: It's commonly used for memoizing callback functions, especially when passing those functions to child components.

// useEffect is used for handling side effects and executing code after rendering or when certain dependencies change.
// useMemo is used to memoize the result of a function or expression to prevent unnecessary recalculations.
// useCallback is used to memoize functions, especially useful for optimizing child components that depend on callback functions.
